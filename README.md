# Product-store
 This project is a simple CRUD application built using the MERN stack. It allows users to perform the basic operations on a set of data. The application will have two main parts: a front-end built with React.js and a back-end using Node.js and Express.js. The data is stored in MongoDB, a NoSQL database.
